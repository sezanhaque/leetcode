    A bulb ends up on iff it is switched an odd number of times.

    Call them bulb 1 to bulb n. Bulb i is switched in round d if and only if d divides i.
    So bulb i ends up on if and only if it has an odd number of divisors.

    Divisors come in pairs, like i=12 has divisors 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4.
    Except when i is a square, like 36 has divisors 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, and double divisor 6.
    So bulb i ends up on if and only if i is a square.
